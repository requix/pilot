# NARRATIVES

**What stories do you tell yourself about who you are and what you're doing?**

Narratives are the sense-making stories that shape your identity and actions. They can empower or limit you. Make them conscious.

## Examples

### About Myself

**"I'm a builder, not a manager"**  
**The Story:** I'm happiest when creating systems, not managing people  
**Evidence:** Most energized during design/build phases, drained by 1-on-1s and admin work  
**Impact:** I prioritize IC track, avoid management opportunities  
**Is it serving me?:** Mostly yes - keeps me focused on strengths. But need to develop some leadership skills even as IC.

**"I learn best by doing"**  
**The Story:** Reading doesn't stick, but building something makes it permanent  
**Evidence:** Tutorials never stick, but projects I've built I remember years later  
**Impact:** I jump into projects quickly, sometimes too quickly  
**Is it serving me?:** Yes for learning, but sometimes I should read docs first to avoid obvious pitfalls.

### About My Work

**"Infrastructure is the foundation everything else builds on"**  
**The Story:** My work matters because bad infrastructure makes everything else harder  
**Evidence:** Seen teams blocked by poor deployment tools, slow CI/CD, unreliable systems  
**Impact:** I focus on reliability and developer experience  
**Is it serving me?:** Yes - gives purpose and direction

**"Automation is always worth it"**  
**The Story:** Time spent automating is always recovered  
**Evidence:** Scripts I wrote years ago still save hours weekly  
**Impact:** I automate aggressively, sometimes over-automating trivial tasks  
**Is it serving me?:** Mostly yes, but need to calculate ROI better (don't spend 8 hours automating a 10-minute task)

---

### About My Team

**"We're understaffed but making it work"**  
**The Story:** We're doing great despite having half the people we need  
**Evidence:** Team is stretched, working long hours, still shipping  
**Impact:** Pride in accomplishment, but also burnout risk  
**Is it serving me?:** No - this narrative prevents me from advocating for more resources. Need to reframe.

---

### About My Industry

**"The cloud wars are accelerating innovation"**  
**The Story:** AWS/Azure/GCP competition drives better tools faster  
**Evidence:** New features announced constantly, prices dropping, capabilities expanding  
**Impact:** I stay current with cloud tech, embrace cloud-native approaches  
**Is it serving me?:** Yes - keeps me competitive and excited

---

### About My Future

**"I want to be known for making complex systems accessible"**  
**The Story:** My legacy will be simplifying complexity and teaching others  
**Evidence:** Feedback says I'm good at explaining hard concepts, documentation I write gets referenced  
**Impact:** I prioritize clear communication, documentation, mentoring  
**Is it serving me?:** Yes - aligns with mission and brings satisfaction

## Why This Matters

Your PILOT agent uses narratives to:
- Understand your self-perception
- Challenge limiting narratives
- Reinforce empowering narratives
- Suggest when a narrative might be outdated

---

## Tips

- **Make them explicit**: Unconscious narratives control you
- **Question regularly**: "Is this story true? Is it serving me?"
- **Update when evidence changes**: Narratives should evolve
- **Challenge limiting narratives**: "I'm not technical enough" → "I'm learning rapidly"
- **Embrace empowering narratives**: "I solve hard problems"

---

## Narrative Red Flags

Watch for these limiting patterns:
- "I'm not a [X] person" (Fixed mindset)
- "I always [fail at Y]" (Learned helplessness)
- "They don't [value/understand] me" (Victim mentality)
- "I should be further along" (Comparison trap)

These narratives can be reframed:
- "I'm not a math person" → "I'm learning math at my own pace"
- "I always fail at public speaking" → "I'm improving with practice"
- "They don't value my work" → "I need to communicate impact better"
- "I should be further along" → "I'm exactly where I need to be, learning what I need"
