# BELIEFS

**What core convictions guide your decisions?**

These are your foundational truths - the principles you won't compromise. They shape how you approach problems and make tradeoffs.

## My Core Beliefs

### [Belief Category 1: e.g., Software Engineering]

1. **[Belief]**: [Explanation]
   - **Why**: [Reasoning]
   - **Exception**: [When you'd break this rule]

2. **[Belief]**: [Explanation]
   - **Why**: [Reasoning]
   - **Exception**: [When you'd break this rule]

## Example

### Software Engineering

1. **Simple is better than clever**
   - **Why**: Clever code is hard to maintain. Simple code anyone can understand.
   - **Exception**: When performance truly demands it (measure first)

2. **Tests are not optional**
   - **Why**: Untested code is legacy code from day one
   - **Exception**: Quick prototypes that will be thrown away

3. **Automate repetitive work**
   - **Why**: Humans are bad at repetitive tasks. Machines are great at them.
   - **Exception**: When automation costs more than manual work

### Infrastructure

1. **Everything as code**
   - **Why**: Manual changes don't scale and can't be reviewed
   - **Exception**: Emergency hotfixes (but document and codify after)

2. **Observability is not optional**
   - **Why**: Can't fix what you can't see
   - **Exception**: Throwaway dev environments

3. **Security from the start, not bolted on**
   - **Why**: Retrofitting security is expensive and incomplete
   - **Exception**: None - this is non-negotiable

### Team & Process

1. **Communication over perfect solutions**
   - **Why**: Great solution no one understands is worse than good solution everyone gets
   - **Exception**: Critical systems where perfection matters

2. **Document the why, not just the what**
   - **Why**: Code shows what, comments show how, docs should show why
   - **Exception**: When why is obvious (but it rarely is)

3. **Move fast, but don't break things**
   - **Why**: Speed without safety is recklessness
   - **Exception**: True prototypes (but label them clearly)

### Learning & Growth

1. **Teaching is the best way to learn**
   - **Why**: You don't truly understand until you can explain it
   - **Exception**: When you genuinely don't understand yet

2. **Embrace failure as data**
   - **Why**: Failures teach more than successes
   - **Exception**: Preventable failures (learn from others' mistakes)

## Why This Matters

Your PILOT agent uses beliefs to:
- Make suggestions aligned with your values
- Question decisions that contradict beliefs
- Explain tradeoffs through your lens
- Keep you consistent with your principles

---

## Tips

- **Be honest**: These are YOUR beliefs, not what sounds good
- **Include exceptions**: Rigid beliefs are brittle
- **Review regularly**: Beliefs evolve with experience
- **Reference in decisions**: "This violates my belief that..."
