# PILOT - Self-Learning Engineering Assistant for Kiro

**Structured methodology. Persistent memory. Continuous learning.**

PILOT extends Kiro with:
- **The Algorithm** — OBSERVE → THINK → PLAN → BUILD → EXECUTE → VERIFY → LEARN
- **Memory** — Captures solutions and applies them to future work
- **Identity** — Knows your goals, projects, and working style

## The Algorithm

Every task follows seven phases:

1. **OBSERVE** — Understand before acting
2. **THINK** — Generate approaches
3. **PLAN** — Select strategy
4. **BUILD** — Define success criteria
5. **EXECUTE** — Do the work
6. **VERIFY** — Test against criteria
7. **LEARN** — Capture verified insights

**Core principle:** Define what success looks like BEFORE you execute.

## Requirements

- [Kiro](https://kiro.dev) installed
- macOS or Linux (bash required)
- (Optional) Enable semantic search: `kiro-cli settings chat.enableKnowledge true`

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/requix/pilot.git
cd pilot
./install.sh
```

Run: `kiro-cli --agent pilot`

## What to Expect

After install, PILOT will:
- Follow the Algorithm for complex tasks
- Remember solutions that work
- Learn your preferences over time
